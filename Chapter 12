Testing terms:
- Unit tests: focus on only one unit like: method or class.
- Feature tests: test how the units work together.
- Application test: tests the behavior whole application.
- Regression test: Didn't get it yet!

Tests files:
- tests/Feature
- tests/Unit

Running tests:
- type ./vendor/bin/phpunit in the command line
- dot: passed, F: failed
- Any method starts with test will work
- Any method with the @test will work

Making a test:
- php artisan make:test nameOfTest

Envoironment:
- you can add .env parameter in testing environment int phpunit.xml with:
     <env name="DB_CONNECTION" value="mysql" />

Unit test:
- You can test a single method or class even it is connected to a framework

Application testing:
- HTTP tests:
    = get, post, put, patch, delete
    = you can use them all with json api, for example: getJson
- auth:
    = actingAs()

Assertions:
- AssertOk: checks for status code 200 response
- AssertStatus: checks for a status
- AssertSee, AssertDontSee: the response contains text or no
- AssertJson: check if it is in Json format
- AssertViewHas: check if view has key (or and value)
- AssertSessionHas: check if session has key
- AssertCookie: check if cookie has key
- AssertCookieExpired: check if cookie has expired key
- AssertCookieNotExpired: check if cookie has key that is not expired
- AssertRedirect: check if the page redirects to a route


Database tests:
- assertDatabaseHas($tablename, [$col => $val], $connection = optionally)
- assetrDatabaseMissing($tablename, [$col => $val], $connection = optionally)
- seeds allowed

Testing other laravel systems:
- you can check if the data was dispatched to the API without really sending it using event fake
- but & queue fake
- mail fake
- notification fake
- storage fake

WithoutExceptionHandling:
- is used to test the request without expecting exceptions

Mocking:
- mocking allows you to make a similar things to classes without instantiate them
- Mockery
- shouldRecieve() // tests if the facade recieves some message and you can customize the numbers it received it

Artisan commands testing

Browser tesing:
- Dusk
- BrowserKit

Working with Dusk:
- installing Dusk
    = composer require --dev laravel/dusk
    = php artisan dusk:install
- php artisan dusk // like ./vendor/bin/phpunit
- php artisan dusk:make someTest
-
