Laravel provides the same abstraction for all mail and notification providers with the need to change the configuration only

To use any of the could baes API drivers you will need Guzzle:
composer require guzzlehttp/guzzle

To use SES driver use the following command:
composer require aws/aws-sdk-php:~3.0

There are two different ways to send emails in Laravel: classic and mailable

classic was for <= 5.2


Mailable:
    - php artisan make:mail UserCreated
    - build to set the subject, body..etc
    - sending: Mail:to("m@e.c")->send(new MailClass([]));

Mail Templates:
    - HTML vs Plain Text emails: use text() instead of view to return text instead of HTML

Build methods:
    - from
    - subject
    - attach
    - attachData
    - attachFromStorage
    - priority
    - withSwiftMessage

Attachments and inline images:
    - ->attach(storage_path(), $options)
    - ->attachData(storage_path(), $options)
    - ->attachFromStorage() // another filesystem like s3

Markdown Mailable:
    - ->markdown()

Rendering Mailable on browser:
    - you can render the email directly by custom route returning an instance of the mailable class

Queues:
    - Mail::queue() instead of Mail::send()
    - Mail::later() the same but with scheduled time
    - to make the mailable always queued implement the Illuminate\Contracts\Queue\ShouldQueue interface

Local Development:
    - three ways: log driver, SaaS (Mailtrap), "universal to"

Notifications:
    -
