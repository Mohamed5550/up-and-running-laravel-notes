Laravel Homestead:
it is a tool for servers and virtuals boxes

Lambo: a tool made by the book owner to make the repeated steps after creating a new laravel project every time, like:
- laravel new.
- committing the project to Git
- setting .env credentials with reasonable defaults.
- Open the project in browser.
- open the project in the code editor (Optinoaly).

.env file: where you put your environment configurations.
.env.example: where you define what configurations you need but without valus. (for others to specify).

For env, it is not good to use it outside the config files, because of the cache, so, for each env variable, set a config term for it.


To run the project in the browser, use `php artisan serve` in command line.
- It opens be default in the link: http://localhost:8000
